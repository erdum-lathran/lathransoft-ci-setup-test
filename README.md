## Overview

This project is designed to implement [describe the purpose of the project, e.g., a real-time chat application, an inventory management system, etc.]. The main goal of this application is to [state the purpose briefly, like "provide a seamless chat interface for users" or "track and manage inventory effectively"]. The project uses Node.js for the server-side environment and Redis for caching, which helps improve performance.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (>= version 22.x.x): Node.js is the runtime used for running the backend server.
- **Redis**: A powerful in-memory data structure store, used as a cache and message broker in this application.

### Installing Node.js

To install Node.js, visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

### Installing Redis

1. **On macOS**:  
   You can use Homebrew to install Redis:
   ```bash
   brew install redis
   ```

2. **On Windows**:  
   Download the Redis installer from [here](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases). Follow the installation instructions for your version of Windows.

3. **On Linux**:  
   On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install redis-server
   ```

### Start Redis Server

Once Redis is installed, start the Redis server by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
redis-server
```

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stsajid/Lathransuite-Backend_dms_2.0.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd [project-directory]
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Project in Development Mode

Run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the server and the application should now be running locally. You can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whatever port is specified in the project).

## Usage

[Include any specific usage instructions here, like API endpoints, user instructions, etc.]

Example:

- **GET /api/users**: Fetches a list of all users.
- **POST /api/messages**: Sends a message to the chat system.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, fork the repository and create a pull request with your proposed changes. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and passes all tests.
